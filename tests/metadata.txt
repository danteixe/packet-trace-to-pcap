The files in this directory are used for testing the corresponding script. They are collections of 
packet captures made using the Cisco IOS-XE QFP Packet Tracer feature.

They were collected in a virtual environment using Catalyst 8000v virtual routers, running IOS-XE 17.9.4a.
The devices were arranged in a topology similar to the one below:

 +-------+       +-------+       +-------+
 |  R1   | G1    |  R2   | G2    |  R3   |
 |       +-------+       +-------+       |
 |       |    G1 |       |    G1 |       |
 +-------+       +-------+       +-------+
  vvvvvvv         vvvvvvv         vvvvvvv
  from            through         to

We collect packet traces with 4 types of traffic:

- ICMP traffic generated with IP SLA.
- UDP traffic generated with IP SLA.
- TCP traffic generated with IP SLA.
- IPSEC-encrypted traffic sent through a GRE over IPSEC tunnel.
